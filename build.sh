echo "get go dependencies"
go get github.com/gin-gonic/gin
go get github.com/gin-contrib/static
go get github.com/sirupsen/logrus
go get github.com/mazeForGit/WordlistExtractor

echo "create the application binary wich is referenced by Procfile"
go build -o bin/application server.go

chmod +x bin/application
